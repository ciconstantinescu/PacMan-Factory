# PacMan-Factory

**Description:** This project allows for an interactive game in which the user can create countless PacMan figure which float about on the screen. 

**How to Run:** In order to run this, you have to download all files: .html, .css, .js AND the images (.jpg). They must all be stored in the same folder in order to run together and animate the movement. 

**Future improvements:** This exercise could be improved by: 1) having automated feed of PacMan figure onto the screen (rather than controled by user) at a certain interval, and 2) adding rules that can prevent the PacMan figures to run into each other during their floating time on the screen by giving the user permission and privilege to anihilate as many as possible to achieve that goal. In this way, the game can keep score and declare the winner as the user who can prevent the most run-ins. 

**License:** Created during and for MIT coursework (Professional Coding Women's Cohort certificate).
